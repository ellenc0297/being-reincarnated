# You chose to Wake Up!

You woke up and slammed the snooze button on the alarm. Then you got out of bed and prepared for the day. As you walked, you thought it was going to be another boring day at work.

At work you walked to your cubicle and sat down. You wonder when you boss was going to come in and assign work, when people with guns bursted into the room and started shooting at everybody! You tried to hide but you got hit.
