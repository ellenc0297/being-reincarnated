# You chose to fight for the kingdom

You agree to help the kingdom and the king is overjoyed. He told you to rest and prepare for a meeting tommorrow. Then he told the assistant to bring you to an unoccupied guest room. You and the assistant walked for a couple minutes until he stopped at a door and said "this is your room now." You walk into your new room and is surprised at how large the room is. Your room has many things, it has a large bed, a closet, windows, rugs, and more. You say goodbye to the assistant and went to sleep on the bed.
