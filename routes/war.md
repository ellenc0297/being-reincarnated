# You chose War!

You opened your eyes and woke up in a bright room. You see a person looking at you in shock then running out the room. You ignored them and looked at your hands and arms and it confirmed that you are in someone else's body. Then you see the same person running back with someone else following them. The person announced "this is the king, bow down!" You bow down and the king explained that he needed someone to fight for his kingdom and that's why you are in that body. He explained that they put a spell on the body to capture the souls of people and have someone always monitoring it. He asks "Will you help protect and fight for my kingdom?"
